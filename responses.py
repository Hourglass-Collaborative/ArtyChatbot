#Our Values
values = "At Hourglass Collaborative, all of our work is centered around six core values:<br><br><strong>The World is Abundant:</strong> We believe in limitless possibilities. Our approach is grounded in a mindset of abundance. We encourage our collaborators to leave the outdated principles of scarcity thinking in the past where they belong.  When we discard our limiting beliefs, we can recognize the vastness of what's possible.<br><br><strong>Aethestics Have Power:</strong> Aesthetics command attention, and attention is the currency of the internet. The right aesthetic resonance brings people into a heightened state of alertness. Aesthetics have the power to freeze time, spotlighting your message and jolting the observer into the present,<br><br><strong>Joy Support Better Thinking:</strong> Research shows that positivity promotes receptiveness, innovation, and breakthroughs. Our programs aim to help clients achieve their goals by emphasizing a positive and uplifting atmosphere. We prioritize creating joyful environments to enhance cognitive function.<br><br><strong>Space Is Magical:</strong> Environments have rhythms, energies, and embedded values. Spaces are powerful, active participants in our journey, silently guiding our thoughts and influencing our decisions. When designed with purpose, spaces can elevate experiences and spark profound transformations<br><br><strong>Disrupt Unjust Systems:</strong> We routinely challenge and dismantle inequitable systems, advocate for human-centered practices, and eliminate unethical structures. In our work, we equip our clients with the tools to evaluate, question, and redesign their organizations to create equitable and inclusive outcomes.<br><br><strong>Eliminate Waste:</strong> Our principle of eliminating waste is built on an ethos of energy preservation, resource management, time efficiency, and collective stewardship of our planet. We value precision, clarity of thinking, relentless editing, and the proactive mitigation of externalities. #CoreValues #OurValues"
